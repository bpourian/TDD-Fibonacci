# TDD Fibonacci Kata

This is the simple Fibonacci Kata which I had previously completed without TDD.
I am bored and wanted to code for fun so I built this. However in this app I will try and introduce a dynamic programming approach called 'memorisation'.

The idea is that if the program is used in a repl like irb, the value of the solutions will be stored in memory. Therefore as the range of numbers given increases the program doesn't have to compute all the calculations which it has already saved.
